Background 📘
Path finding algorithms are a foundational concept in computer science, used in various fields from gaming to robotics to transport. This visualizer provides an engaging way to understand and appreciate their mechanics.

Algorithms Explained 🤔
BFS (Breadth-First Search): BFS explores nodes level-by-level, radiating out from the starting point. It guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph or grid.

DFS (Depth-First Search): DFS dives deep into one direction before backtracking, exploring as far as possible along each branch. It doesn't guarantee the shortest path in a grid environment.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: This method finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It continually searches the node with the smallest known distance from the start node. In our visualization, the final path is highlighted, making the animation seem almost instantaneous.

Future Enhancements 🚧
Integrate more path-finding algorithms such as A*, Bidirectional Search, etc.
Implement maze generation techniques.
Add the ability to adjust weights and consider obstacles.
